<h1>Approximating pi from human actions</h1>

Approximating $\pi$ (~3.14159265358979323846) has been a task of immense interest for humans. There have been many ingenious methods to calculate $\pi$. Here, we explore a new one -- Can we approximate $\pi$ from human actions as they try to move in circles in a video game?

The answer is, of course, yes. Where there are circles, there must be $\pi$. In this work, we build upon one of the earliest methods humans developed to approximate $\pi$ from player trajectories. Archimedes had observed that, with an increasing number of sides (n), regular n-sided polygons become increasingly better approximations of circles. This simple observation led him to develop one of the earliest methods to calculate $\pi$ as the ratio between the perimeter of the n-polygon and its largest diagonal.

In this page, we will look at its application in estimating $\pi$ from human trajectories in a video game. The game our human players played is Space Fortress (Mane and Donchin, 1989). The game was developed as a common complex task for several different research groups studying complex task learning. Even after more than 3 decades, the game is still widely used as an experimental paradigm to study complex task learning (e.g., Gray & Lindstedt, 2017; Anderson et al, 2019; Rahman & Gray, 2020; 2021) and been the testbed for numerous theories of human decision-making and learning. Recently, it has also been thrown as a challenge for reinforcement learning agents (Agarwal, Hope, & Sycara, 2019). As we will see, although the flight paths taken by our players are not regular polygons, this ratio can still be used to approximate $\pi$ for each full circle around the Fortress.

In the game, players fly a ship in circles around the enemy HQ (i.e., the Space Fortress) and attack to destroy it. The optimal path is circles, which our players have been informed of. But, it is difficult to implement. The game controls dictate that the players have to construct the circles with straight lines. In other words, they have to approximate circles with polygons. A direct consequence is -- the better the polygons are as approximations of circles (which equates to, the higher number of straight lines as the sides of the polygons), the better would be the approximations of $\pi$ according to Archimedes' method to approximate $\pi$. Another way to look at it: Approximations of $\pi$ provides a measure of performance in moving in circles.

These results have been presented and published at the $19^th International Conference on Cognitive Modeling (ICCM). The full paper (Rahman & Gray, 2021) can be found here: https://iccm-conference.neocities.org/2021/papers/612.pdf

Finally, we take a few minutes to marvel at the simple beauty of Archimedes' method and have some fun with it. Combining our knowledge of calculus, we devise a simple way to approximate $\pi$ to many digits using just our computers or, if needed, using a pocket calculator. This exercise is meant mostly for fun, but may come in handy if we find ourselves in need to quickly but accurately approximate $\pi$ in a doomsday situation with aliens invading us and we have no internet. We also discuss why this method worked in approximating $\pi$ from the actions of our human players.
